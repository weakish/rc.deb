This package provides syntax highlight file for vim, but it is not enabled
per default. If you want to enable it for your user account just execute
`vim-addons install rc`. Similarly, to enable it for all users of this
system just execute (as root) `vim-addons -w install rc`. vim-addons is
provided by the vim-addon-manager package, have a look at its manpage
for more information.
